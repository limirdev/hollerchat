# hollerchat
I want to create a truly distributed chat client with strong end-to-end encryption.

Ideas:
* bittorrent-like tech can provide offline messaging by intermediate storing messages in the network
* sufficiently strong encryption is needed for secure messaging via potentially hostile hosts
* larger files: only direct transmission when recipient is online, or provide for intermediate storage in the network?
