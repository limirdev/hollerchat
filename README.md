P2P messaging

Ideas:
* bittorrent-like tech can provide offline messaging by intermediate storing messages in the network
* sufficiently strong encryption is needed for secure messaging via potentially hostile hosts
* larger files: only direct transmission when recipient is online, or provide for intermediate storage in the network?

Public messaging:
* public channels? hashtags?
* follow people/hashtags/channels?

Private messaging:
* contact list
* messages outside contact list in quarantine
* private channels/groups

Tech
* berty protocol? https://github.com/berty/berty
